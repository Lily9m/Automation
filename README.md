# ETL_Practice

The go.mod and go.sum files are responsible for generating random data that populates the sales_data.csv file.
The SALESABC.sql script creates a table and loads data into it. Additionally, it includes a step to load newly inserted records.
The Script_sales.py script is designed to load newly inserted records into the MSSQL database.
These components work together to ensure efficient data management and seamless data integration.
